Android application for managing a club


After talking with a stakeholder, who works at a sport club specialized on child sport, I decided to create an application to help better manage the activities in the club.
The idea behind it is that through the application, the coaches who work there will be able to schedule practices throught the week, that will be visible to everyone everyone
who is using the app. The schedule can be changed later, with the users being notified of it. The coaches can also post different messages on the main screen. The app may also 
include chat rooms.
